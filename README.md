this is a brainfuck interpreter for python using numbers.
esolang link for brainfuck https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck 

feel free to make changes to the code for optimization or bugs or i may have gotten something wrong.

by using numbers i mean that there is no support for numbers to be outputted or inputted and the only things that work is numbers. this is because i find numbers much more fun than characters/strings to mess around with. 

most of the stuff in the file should be pretty self-explanatory, though at some points it might be hard to understand. I will at some point add additional documentation.

Also sorry if the code is a bit shit I did write it in an hour at 11 pm which is not that late but I do need my sleep. 

Thx for checking out my stuff !
